🔐 Secure File System – Python Encryption & Decryption
📌 Overview
The Secure File System is a Python-based project that provides fundamental file-level encryption and decryption functionalities. Built with a focus on simplicity and data security, this system allows users to protect sensitive text files using custom or standard encryption techniques. It mimics the behavior of a basic secure file vault, ensuring that data at rest remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access.

This project offers an educational insight into cryptography, file handling, and user authentication logic, making it highly relevant for students studying Information Security, Applied Cryptography, or general-purpose Python development.

🔒 Key Features
🔹 Encrypt and decrypt .txt files securely

🔹 Custom encryption logic (e.g., character shifting, XOR cipher, etc.)

🔹 User prompts for encryption keys or passwords

🔹 Command-line interface (CLI) or basic menu system for usability

🔹 Prevents unauthorized reading of encrypted content

🔹 Modular and well-commented code for easy customization

Note: The project can be upgraded to use modern libraries like cryptography or Fernet if needed, but the current version focuses on manual implementation of logic for learning purposes.
